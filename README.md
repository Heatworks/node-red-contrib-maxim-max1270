# node-red-contrib-adafruit-max31855
Node-RED node for communicating with an Adafruit MAX31855 module. (Unofficial)

## How it works:

The simpliest way to read from the SPI was to use Adafruit's python library and then invoke it from node.

## Future

Add a paramter for number of checks, allow multiple channels.
